#summary Frequently asked questions and troubleshooting

= FAQ =

=== Will you support XXX? ===
We're building on top of [http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/ gdata-python-client], so if you don't see it supported there, we won't be supporting it in the foreseeable future.

=== How do I apply patches? ===
If you're as impatient as I am (not recommended), and on some flavor of Linux, try this:

{{{
$ cd /path/to/python/libraries
$ sudo patch -p0 -i /path/to/patch_file
}}}

I *really* recommend reading a proper tutorial on the `patch` command first, though. How about [http://www.linuxtutorialblog.com/post/introduction-using-diff-and-patch-tutorial this one]?

The path used in the `cd` command depends on your operating system and how GoogleCL was installed. For me (Ubuntu 9.10, using setup.py) it is `/usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages`

For Windows, you need to download a patch tool. You could also check out the svn repository by downloading an svn tool (try TortoiseSVN) and following the instructions [http://code.google.com/p/googlecl/source/checkout here]. The repository will have all patches from issues marked "fixed", but has the potential to be more unstable than the releases in the Downloads section.

=== How do I uninstall GoogleCL? ===
Why would I tell you that? :P

Installing from source with `python setup.py install` means you probably need to remove files by hand. [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1550226/python-setup-py-uninstall This] provides some helpful instructions on how to do that.

If you used the .deb, try `sudo dpkg -r /path/to/deb_file`. Replacing the -r with -P will also remove configuration files.

= Troubleshooting =

=== no attribute 'SetOAuthInputParameters' ===
You need a later version of the [http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/ gdata python library]. The earliest version we tested with was 1.2.4.

=== "ValueError: Invalid resource id" when using Docs ===
Upgrading to gdata 2.0.12 seems to fix this. It has been seen in versions as late as 2.0.2.

=== Timestamp too far from current time ===
pigritor reports:
"yep. problem was in system and kernel clock.
I read this: http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Time_Synchronization
then:"
{{{
$ sudo htpdate -ds google.com;
$ sudo tzselect;
$ TZ='[SELECTED_TIME_ZONE]'; export TZ;
$ sudo hwclock --systohc
}}}
"and that 'time error' gone "

Issue 55 is currently tracking progress on this issue.
