#summary Complex things that you can do (or we want to be able to do)

*Things we want GoogleCL to be able to do.*

===Upload a photo to picasa then email the link to all your contacts===
Code:
{{{
> picasa post --album album_to_post_to /path/to/photo.jpg
> picasa list url-site --album album_to_post > link_to_photo_in_album.txt
> mail --to contact1,contact2 --subject "New Photo!" link_to_photo_in_album.txt
}}}
Blocking: No Gmail python client library, no write access to gmail (read-only feeds), difficult to list photos unless you know precise tags / name of photo.

===Upload photos in a directory tree to picasa and create a spreadsheet of them===
Code:
{{{
> picasa create --album new_album /path/to/photos/*.jpg
> picasa list title,url-direct --album new_album --delimiter , > new_album.csv
> docs upload new_album.csv
}}}
Blocking: list command as written will list the album data not the data of photos inside
