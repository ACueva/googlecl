#summary How to use GoogleCL.
#labels Featured
Some terminology:
  * service - The Google service being used (Picasa, Blogger, etc.) in all lowercase.
  * task - The task that the service will be doing (tag, post, delete, etc.)

You can also access help by typing {{{$ google.py help}}} or help on a specific service with {{{$ google help <service>}}}. For help with available options and what they mean, use {{{$ google --help}}}

Note that the first time you use a service (like picasa or youtube), you'll have to use a web browser to grant access.  After that, GoogleCL will cache an oauth token in a config directory so that you don't have to login again for that service.

=Services=
Each sub-section corresponds to a service, and each list item is a task that service can do. Each list item follows the format "task: description. {{{example}}}". Note that the example omits the initial {{{$ ./google <service>}}}

==Blogger==
  * delete: Delete posts. {{{delete --title "Silly post number [0-9]*"}}}
  * list: List posts. {{{list title,url-site}}}
  * post: Upload posts. {{{post --tags "GoogleCL, awesome" "Here's a really short post. The next posts will be much longer!" ~/blog/2010/may/*}}}
  * tag: Label posts {{{tag --title "Dev post" --tags "Python, software"}}}

==Calendar==
  * add: Add event to calendar. The text you use is treated as if it were entered using the Quick Add feature of Google Calendar. {{{add "Dinner party with George tomorrow at 6pm"}}}
  * delete: Delete an event. {{{delete --cal "GoogleCL dev cal" --title "Release.*"}}}
  * list: List events. Omitting --date is equivalent to --date today,tomorrow. {{{list --date 2010-06-01,2010-06-30}}}
  * today: List events for the next 24 hours. {{{today}}}

The --date option for calendar will accept the following formats, returning the following events:
 * YYYY-MM-DD: Events on that day
 * YYYY-MM-DD,: Events on and after that day

===The List task===
The list task can be given additional arguments to specify what exactly is being listed. For example,

{{{$ ./google <service> list style1,style2,style3 --delimiter ": "}}}

will output those styles, in that order, with ": " as a delimiter. Valid values for `<`style1`>` etc. are:
  * 'title' - title of the entry.
  * 'url' - treated as 'url-direct' or 'url-site' depending on setting in preferences file.
  * 'url-site' - url of the site associated with the entry.
  * 'url-direct' - url directly to the resource.
  * 'author' - author(s) of the entry.
  * 'when' - "when" data for the entry (typically calendar-only, for start and end date of the event).
  * 'where' - "where" data for the entry (typically calendar-only, for where the event takes place).

The difference between 'url-site' and 'url-direct' is best exemplified by a picasa PhotoEntry: 'url-site' gives a link to the photo in the user's album, 'url-direct' gives a link to the image url. If 'url-direct' is specified but is not applicable, 'url-site' is placed in its stead, and vice-versa.

=Configuration=
GoogleCL also incorporates a configuration file that you can use to customize its behavior, including automatic determination of command line options. Take a look at ConfigurationOptions for documentation on the configuration file.
