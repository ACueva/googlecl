#summary Rules and conventions for expanding GoogleCL

===General===
Follow the Python Style Guide ([http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ PEP 8] and [http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/ PEP 257]).

===Option names===
All options given to optparse should have the same long name and destination name.

===Modules and packages===
New packages should be named after the service they are implementing, and contain a module named service. The service module must define several items:
  * service_class: alternate name for the service being implemented. For example, service_class = CalendarServiceCL
  * tasks: a dictionary mapping names of tasks (e.g. 'list') to util.Task instances.

===Use of util.Task===
Each string (or string element of the list) given to the requires keyword must match one of the options given to optparse.
