=Linux .deb package=

For most people using Ubuntu Karmic (9.10) or newer, installation should be very simple:

   * sudo apt-get install python-gdata
   * `[`download .deb package`]`
   * sudo dpkg -i googlecl`*`.deb

To use GoogleCL with Ubuntu Hardy (8.04), you'll need to install a recent version of the python gdata libraries by hand.  Hardy users won't be able to use the .deb, but GoogleCL runs just fine from the .tar.gz package, no installation necessary, once you have the approprate gdata support in place.  Just download the .tar.gz package, cd src/, and try ./google --help

===python-gdata version===
Note that most versions of Ubuntu only come standard with gdata 1.2, so you may see a message like:

   * "Editing documents is not supported for gdata-python-client < 2.0"

If you need to use tasks unsupported by gdata-1.2, you'll need to manually install a newer version of the gdata and gdata python libraries.  

Or, you could try installing the python-gdata 2.0 .deb file for the upcoming 10.10 (maverick meerkat) release:

sudo dpkg -i https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archive/primary/+files/python-gdata_2.0.8-1.1_all.deb

It seemed to work for me on a Lucid machine, but Your Mileage May Vary.

=Pypi (cheeseshop)=

Trent Mick says that now that we've uploaded it, you should be able to install using one of these commands:

   * {{{ pip install googlecl }}}
   * {{{ pypm install googlecl    # with ActivePython distro }}}

=Mac=

[http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/cgi57/introducing_the_google_command_line_tool/c0seufq Someone] on reddit says that it's available via macports:

   * {{{sudo port install googlecl}}}

If it's not there, run 'sudo port selfupdate', then try again.

And someone [http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/cgi57/introducing_the_google_command_line_tool/c0sew4y else] tells us you can install it using homebrew:

   * {{{brew install googlecl}}}
