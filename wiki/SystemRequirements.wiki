#summary What you need in order to use googleCL

To use googleCL, you'll need python2.5 at a minimum.

You'll also find that some commands will fail unless you have gdata2.0 installed.

Unfortunately, Ubuntu hardy (8.04) and lucid (10.04) don't come with gdata2.0.

The following services work with Ubuntu Hardy using the stock python-gdata and python2.5 packages:

   * blogger
   * calendar add

The following services work with Ubuntu Lucid using the stock python-gdata and python2.6 packages:

   * blogger
   * calendar
   * contacts
   * youtube
