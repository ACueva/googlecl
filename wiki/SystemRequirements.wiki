#summary What you need in order to use googleCL

For most people using Ubuntu Hardy (8.04) or newer, installation should be very simple:

   * sudo apt-get install python-gdata
   * [download .deb package]
   * sudo dpkg -i googlecl*.deb

However, Ubuntu only comes with gdata 1.2, so you may see a message like:

   * "Editing documents is not supported for gdata-python-client < 2.0"

If you need to use tasks unsupported by gdata-1.2, you'll need to manually install a newer version of the gdata and gdata python libraries.
