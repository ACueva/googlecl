#summary What you need in order to use GoogleCL

For most people using Ubuntu Karmic (9.10) or newer, installation should be very simple:

   * sudo apt-get install python-gdata
   * `[`download .deb package`]`
   * sudo dpkg -i googlecl`*`.deb

To use GoogleCL with Ubuntu Hardy (8.04), you'll need to install a recent version of the python gdata libraries by hand.  Hardy users won't be able to use the .deb, but GoogleCL runs just fine from the .tar.gz package, no installation necessary, once you have the approprate gdata support in place.  Just download the .tar.gz package, cd src/, and try ./google --help

Note that all versions of Ubuntu only come standard with gdata 1.2, so you may see a message like:

   * "Editing documents is not supported for gdata-python-client < 2.0"

If you need to use tasks unsupported by gdata-1.2, you'll need to manually install a newer version of the gdata and gdata python libraries.
