#summary What you need in order to use googleCL

For most people using Ubuntu Karmic (9.10) or newer, installation should be very simple:

   * sudo apt-get install python-gdata
   * `[`download .deb package`]`
   * sudo dpkg -i googlecl`*`.deb

Unfortunately, our .deb packages don't work with Ubuntu Hardy (8.04).  However, GoogleCL runs just fine from the .tar.gz package, no installation necessary.  Make sure you have python-gdata installed:

   * sudo apt-get install python-gdata

Then download the .tar.gz package, cd src/, and try ./google --help

Note that all versions of Ubuntu only come standard with gdata 1.2, so you may see a message like:

   * "Editing documents is not supported for gdata-python-client < 2.0"

If you need to use tasks unsupported by gdata-1.2, you'll need to manually install a newer version of the gdata and gdata python libraries.
